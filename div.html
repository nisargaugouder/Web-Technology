            <h1>Sikandar Box Office Collection Day 8:
                Salman Khan's Film Crosses Rs 100 Crore In India</h1>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Salman Khan’s Sikandar is straight-up smashing it at the box office! On just day 8, the action-packed masala
            fest has officially crossed Rs 100 crore in India, and fans are loving it. After a thunderous opening
            weekend,
            the film has managed to keep the momentum going strong through the week.</p>

        <p id="p3">According to the latest numbers, Sikandar added Rs 4.25 crore to its kitty on day 8, pushing its
            total India net
            collection to Rsc102 crore. The film saw a bit of a boost thanks to the weekend crowd trickling in, helping
            it
            finally cross that Rs 100 crore milestone. But here’s the tea: Sikandar opened at Rs 26 crore — not bad, but
            still trailing behind Chhaava, which roared in with Rs 31 crore on day one. By the end of its first week,
            Sikandar stood at Rs 90.25 crore.</p>
