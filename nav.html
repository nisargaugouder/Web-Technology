                <p>The animal kingdom is divided into five infrakingdoms/superphyla, namely Porifera, Ctenophora,
                    Placozoa, Cnidaria and Bilateria. Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a
                    highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric and significantly cephalised
                    body plan, and the vast majority of bilaterians belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes,
                    which includes organisms such as arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the
                    deuterostomes, which include echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains
                    the vertebrates. The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within
                    Bilateria.</p>

                <p>Animals first appeared in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the
                    subsequent Ediacaran period in what is known as the Avalon explosion. Earlier evidence of animals is
                    still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated back to the Tonian period at the
                    start of the Neoproterozoic, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested.[5] Nearly all
                    modern animal phyla first appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian
                    explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the Ordovician
                    radiation 485.4 Mya. Common to all living animals, 6,331 groups of genes have been identified that
                    may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.

                <p>Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus
                    created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema
                    Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided
                    the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa,
                    single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification
                    of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at
                    demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

                <p>Humans make use of many other animal species for food (including meat, eggs, and dairy products), for
                    materials (such as leather, fur, and wool), as pets and as working animals for transportation, and
                    services. Dogs, the first domesticated animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in
                    warfare, as have horses, pigeons and birds of prey; while other terrestrial and aquatic animals are
                    hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals are also an important cultural element of
                    human evolution, having appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are
                    frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry, politics, and sports.</p>
